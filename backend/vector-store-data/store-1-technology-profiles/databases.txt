Technology Profile: Database Technologies Comparison

Category: Data Storage and Retrieval

PostgreSQL:
Type: Relational (SQL)
Licence: PostgreSQL Licence (permissive open source)
Best for: Complex queries, ACID compliance, structured data with relationships, full-text search, JSON/JSONB storage for semi-structured data.
Strengths: Robust data integrity, advanced indexing (B-tree, GIN, GiST), excellent JSON support bridging relational and document models, strong community, extensions ecosystem (PostGIS for geospatial, pg_vector for embeddings). Row-level security for multi-tenant applications.
Weaknesses: More complex initial setup than SQLite or MongoDB. Horizontal scaling requires additional tooling (Citus, read replicas). Can be overkill for simple key-value or document storage needs.
Managed options: Supabase, Neon, AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Railway.

MongoDB:
Type: Document (NoSQL)
Licence: SSPL
Best for: Rapid prototyping, flexible schemas, content management, catalogues, real-time analytics.
Strengths: Flexible document model allows schema evolution without migrations. Horizontal scaling via sharding is built-in. Rich query language with aggregation pipeline. Atlas provides excellent managed hosting with built-in full-text search (Atlas Search).
Weaknesses: Lack of transactions historically (now supported but with performance overhead). Joins are expensive (lookups). Data duplication is common in document design. SSPL licence has implications for some commercial uses.
Managed options: MongoDB Atlas, AWS DocumentDB (compatible but not identical).

SQLite:
Type: Embedded relational (SQL)
Licence: Public domain
Best for: Mobile applications, embedded systems, development/testing, small to medium applications, edge computing.
Strengths: Zero configuration, serverless, single-file database. Extremely fast for read-heavy workloads. No network latency. Excellent for prototyping.
Weaknesses: Limited concurrent write support (single writer). Not suitable for high-concurrency web applications. No built-in user management or access control.

Redis:
Type: In-memory key-value store
Licence: RSALv2 / SSPLv1 (from Redis 7.4+)
Best for: Caching, session storage, real-time leaderboards, pub/sub messaging, rate limiting, queue management.
Strengths: Extremely fast (sub-millisecond latency). Rich data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams). Built-in pub/sub. Lua scripting support.
Weaknesses: Data size limited by memory. Persistence options (RDB snapshots, AOF) add complexity. Not a primary database. Licence change from BSD has caused community friction.

Selection guidance:
For a typical full-stack web application, PostgreSQL is the recommended default. It handles structured data, JSON, full-text search, and can serve as a queue (with SKIP LOCKED) and cache (with materialised views). Pair with Redis for session management and caching in high-traffic scenarios. Use MongoDB when schema flexibility is a primary requirement and relationships between entities are simple.
